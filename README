This project contains a basic implementation of a Django project (Dj4sq) with an app 'foursq_auth'. 
The 'foursq_auth' app uses OAuth to authenticate with Foursquare, so can be extended to create foursquare web apps.

To use:

1. 'git clone git@github.com:martinjc/DjangoFoursquareOAuth.git'
2. Edit settings.py for your database settings
3. Edit views.py to add your foursquare app Client ID and Client Secret
4. Run python manage.py syncdb
5. Run python manage.py runserver
6. ???
7. Profit!

Note: this app is set up for development not production.
